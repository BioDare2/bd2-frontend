<h4>1. How can I prepare journal quality figures from BioDare plots?</h4>

<p>For <b>timeseries plots</b> we recommend to export the numerical data (<code>Download</code> button on Show Data screen).<br>
The exported cvs file will contain the exactly same data which were used to generate the BioDare plots,
i.e. after applying the selected detrending, normalization or alignment. You can then render your own plots using your
  favourite program (Excel, Origin...).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could right click on the plot and download it from the browser. Remember to enlarge the screen as
the plot should be about 4 times larger than its final size in the paper</p>

<p>We are aware that it would be difficult to reproduce our beautiful <b>period and phases plots</b>, for that reason
we provided the export to SVG function. After downloading the plot in .svg format (a vector graphic format) you can open
  it and edit in a suitable program, like the free <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. There you can change the lines or fonts
  to meet publishers requirements as well as convert to a raster format like: jpg, png, tiff.</p>
<p><i>Hint</i> Ctrl+click on element in Inkscape to access its properties without the need of ungrouping all the graphic.</p>
