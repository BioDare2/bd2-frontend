  <h2>Conditions of BioDare Service (2017 v1.0)</h2>

  <p>We would like BioDare to become a community resource for data sharing, preferably in public but also in private
    collaborations. For researchers who deposit data (depositors), however, the primary objective is analysis of
    rhythmic data and the main concern is getting appropriate credit for their work. We try to balance those needs,
    providing a sustainable service that promotes Open Research.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic principles</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Storing and sharing research data in BioDare is and will always remain free</li>
    <li>Access to publicly available data is and will always remain free</li>
    <li>Simple period analysis is and will always remain free</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data ownership and sharing</h3>
  <p>
    Data uploaded to BioDare remains the intellectual property of the depositor, their research group or institution.
    Responsibility for data accuracy and data management remains with the depositors.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default data sets in BioDare are private for the first 3 years after their creation. Unless the embargo period is
    extended, data sets will be shared under the Creative Commons Attribution License. The embargo period and licencing
    may be changed on request.
  </p>

  <h3>Data longevity</h3>
  <p>
    Typical for academic world, we do not have guaranteed indefinite funding so we cannot promise indefinite service.
    However,
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have secured funding for the next 3 years; our previous funding for BioDare has been continuous for the past 8
      years.</li>
    <li>In case of discontinuance of BioDare, we will try to move publicly available data to a suitable, general
      repository</li>
    <li>We will notify data owners and provide the means to retrieve all their data, metadata and analysis results</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How we may use your data</h3>
  <p>
    We may need to access your private records to solve technical issues or to offer you technical assistance. We will
    respect data confidentiality and such access will be done by software developers who are not involved in biological
    research.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to validate new analysis methods we may use the numerical values of timeseries data but such numerical data
    will be stripped of any biological context and not suitable for anything other than numerical analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may monitor how you interact with BioDare or the extent of your metadata. This information will be aggregated
    into metrics across many or all users in order to report data sharing practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Fees and levels of service</h3>
  <p>
    We are running BioDare as a non-profit service and we provide a standard account that is free to academic users. We
    incur costs in providing, maintaining and developing BioDare. To sustain the service we need to secure funding,
    either from users subscribing to a group account (intended for research units or laboratories), or directly from
    funding agencies. To secure grant funding, we must demonstrate that BioDare is a useful community resource,
    operating within the funders’ guidelines. This is why we promote Open Research, for example through automatic data
    release after the embargo period.
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard, free account offers all the essentials for circadian research:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>data upload</li>
    <li>timeseries visualization</li>
    <li>period analysis with FFT NLLS</li>
    <li>summary statistics</li>
    <li>data and results export</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The availability of additional analysis or visualizations may be restricted for standard accounts (for example with
    a usage limit). In each case, we will offer methods to lift such restrictions through “community activities” chosen
    by depositors, such as decreasing the embargo period, providing data curation or providing a more detailed metadata
    description.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group account holders benefit from the full set of BioDare features including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>collaboration options</li>
    <li>extended embargo periods and licensing options</li>
    <li>unlimited access to all analysis and visualisation methods</li>
    <li>management of user accounts within their group</li>
    <li>management of assets in bulk, for example publishing multiple data sets</li>
    <li>programmatic access to period analysis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most funding bodies now recognise and fund the costs of data management, and expect that grants should include such
    costs. We therefore encourage you to help sustain this circadian-specific resource by subscribing to a research
    group account, and charging the subscription to a relevant research grant. Specialised online resources such as
    BioDare can benefit research communities by immediately providing data analysis tools in a standard fashion, by
    allowing data comparison among labs in the medium term, and by promoting post-publication re-analysis of data in the
    long term. We can provide you with text suitable for the data management plan in your grant applications, to justify
    including the modest subscription costs for BioDare.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future, we may introduce “on-demand” features to the standard, free account, without the need for a full,
    group account. Examples might include payment for an extended data embargo period. These will always be add-on
    features and will not affect the basic usage of the standard account.
  </p>

  <h3>Acknowledging BioDare and data sets</h3>
  <p>
    We request that you cite BioDare using the references displayed on the BioDare web pages, which will be occasionally
    updated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please do not use only a citation for BioDare when you refer to data retrieved from BioDare. Best practice is to use
    a dataset citation, if appropriate with a citation to the publication that describes the dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help the process of data citation, we strongly encourage you to refer formally to your datasets in a separate
    section of your publications. BioDare URLs can be provided to facilitate this process.
  </p>
