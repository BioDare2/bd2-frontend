  <h2>Embargo Period Explained</h2>

  <p>
    As described in the Service Description, each experiment (dataset) becomes publicly available
    3 years after its creation. <br/>
    For example, an experiment created on 5th May 2018 is ready for public release on 6th May 2021.
  </p>
  <p>We lagged in the public release of existing data, but we are starting the automatic process now in 2024.
    <br/>The releases will be made in tranches organized by the creation date (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)
    over the course of the next 12 months, and will then be made on a continuous basis.
  </p>
  <h3>Paid, Increased Embargos</h3>
  <p>
    The default 3-year embargo period can be extended to 5 or 10 years by paying a yearly subscription fee.
  </p>
  <p>Each experiment created during the 'paid' year will have the release date automatically
    increased to 5 (or 10) years in the future.
    <br/>
    For example, if you paid a subscription for a 5-year embargo in 2023, all the data created in that year won't be released
    before 2028. However, data created after 2023 will only have the default 3-year embargo unless you pay for a new subscription.
  </p>
  <h3>What About Existing Data?</h3>
  <p>We are aware that by not releasing the data automatically after 3 years, we created a false
    sense of 'security' that the data would remain private, which might have prevented users from paying for longer embargo periods.</p>
  <p>For this reason, we offer the option to pay for higher-tier subscriptions for past years
    as well.</p>

  <h3>Subscription Prices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Subscription with a 5-year embargo: £120 per year</li>
    <li>Subscription with a 10-year embargo: £240 per year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can pay upfront for multiple years.</p>
  <p>The prices are calculated based on our running costs per experiment and assume that each user creates 10 experiments per year on average.</p>
